# Here's how it works:
1. On roll we call `orng.wax::requestrand` (**The official RNG smart contract**) with the assoc_id (For example 1 for jackpots) and signing_value (Generated in the backend, could be user input for different games)
2. The smart contract then returns the data to `[youraccountname]::receiverand` (Authorized by `oracle.wax`) containing a string as prefix (determined by the assoc_id) with a hash attached generated from the data that oracle.wax generated.
3. We put the whole string in the following function to retrieve a number from 0 - 1 (0 - 100%).
```js
let random_value = "0100000000000000xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";

// 0100000000000000 = prefix (determined by the assoc_id)
// xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx = random hash attached generated by `oracle.wax`

// Extract hash
let hash = random_value.substr(16);

// calculate function
function calcPercent(hash) {
  var seed = parseInt(hash, 16);
  var x = Math.sin(seed) * 10000;
  return x - Math.floor(x);
}

let percent = calcPercent(hash);
```
4. We then multiply that random number from 0 - 1 with the pot total worth in US-Cents and ceil it to get the Winning Ticket.

```js
let winningTicket = Math.ceil(potWorth * outcome);
```
